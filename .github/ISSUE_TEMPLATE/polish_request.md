Makes the app "better" by making the app simpler, more stable, more powerful, faster, or somehow adds to existing functionality that may or may not be obvious to a user.

## Why is this polish important?

Identify the issue/functionality the feature will address. Example: Currently takes 30 minutes to assign users' roles one by one. Bulk uploads will save our power users time and headaches.

## Describe the solution

Clearly define the requirements that need to be fulfilled to address the use case. These requirements should be clear enough for any team member to address on their own.

Include visuals if possible. For complex features please use the "Additional Context" section.

## Additional context
